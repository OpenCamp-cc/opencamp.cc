#### Backend Course Information

Our Backend curriculum is designed for Software Engineers with 1-2 years of

compared to your peers to catch up and learn at the same pace as them.

Key Topics:
- Principles behind Reliable Distributed Systems

- Understanding Failures
- Replication and Partitioning
- Monitoring and Observability
- Event Driven Systems
- HTTP vs RPC

There will be a multi-week assignment which involves design, discussion, and
implementation of a distributed system that is capable of handling real-world
traffic.

During the duration of the course, you will have:
- unlimited access to the instructor(s) via Email or Discord
- access to recorded open office hours to ask questions
- 1-1 meeting with the instructor every 2 weeks to discuss your progress and concerns
