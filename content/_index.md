# Applications for Backend Cohort #0 (March 2025) is now open

Join us now for our very first [Backend Cohort](/docs/curriculum) (Cohort #0, only 5 students) and
be part of our new movement for an open school for Software Engineers.

## Introduction

open camp is an online school focused on training Software
Engineers to bring them up to the next level. We are focused on being **open**,
**challenging**, and most importantly, **affordable**.

Word of warning: open camp is not designed to be easy; it's designed to help
highly motivated folks to challenge themselves to grow even faster.

## Open

All materials that we develop for open camp will be open source and available
for anyone to use. Everyone is welcome to join and participate in our community.

<--->

## Challenging

open camp adopts a flipped classroom learning model. Each week, you will be
reviewing assigned materials, sharing your findings with peers before working on
challenging assignments that will be peer-reviewed and graded by the instructors.

<--->

## Affordable

open camp will be affordable for everyone: the entire course only
costs a total of USD 499 / SGD 680 for 2 months (part-time, online). To keep
costs low, we only use open source and free learning materials as part of our
curriculum, coupled with our own set of assessments and materials that we will
develop over time.

## How is open camp different from other online schools?

The goal of open camp is to develop a community of highly motivated Software
Developers through a low-cost and affordable coding courses. As such, we
operate very differently from other schools which are either profit-centric
or venture-backed.

Our core principles at open camp are:

- **Open**: Use open source and materials that are accessible to all. All materials or projects that we develop for Open Camp will be open source and available for anyone to reference and use, and recorded live sessions can be viewed by anyone with an internet connection.
- **Community-first**: Focus on building a self-supportive community of highly motivated Software Developers that connects our students and alumni with the broader tech communities.
- **Cohort-based**: Peer learning is critical for motivation and pushing each other to achieve more. You will be part of a group of motivated students in the same cohort for peer learning and peer review.
- **Challenging**: open camp is designed to be challenging; anyone can self-learn, but our assignments and homework are designed to challenge you and accelerate the development of your skills
- **Affordablility**: Provide access to the course to as many people as possible with a good learning experience, while ensuring that operational costs are covered.

Where possible, we will work towards further reducing the tuition fees without
affecting the quality of our instruction in the future. In the future, if we
can cover our operational cost without the need to collect tuition fees, we
will pursue this path as well.

## What’s the catch?

To keep open camp affordable, there are a few notable differences from
traditional online courses or schools:

- A flipped classroom instructional model is used for this course: you will be given a set of materials and tasks to complete prior to each live session where you will review them together with your peers and seek clarification from the instructor
- We will be using a variety of free or open source learning materials, coupled with our own assessment and learning materials
- open camp is conducted entirely online to minimize operational costs

At the moment, we are conducting this schools in the GMT+8 timezone, and
students will need to join at least one live-session a week on Mondays from 7pm
to 9pm (GMT+8), or Thursdays from 9am to 11am (GMT+8).

[Check out what time GMT+8 is in your local timezone](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20240108T110000&p1=236&p2=179&p3=95&p4=224).

We hope to offer open camp in more timezones in the future.


## Open? Does that mean I can complete the school by myself? Why should I pay for open camp?

Yes, you can review the entire [Backend course](/docs/curriculum) by yourself once we have
finalised the first version of it after our first cohort (Cohort #0). These
materials will be made available for anyone to use.

There are a few reasons to choose to join open camp instead of self-studying:

- **Structured Cohort Learning**: Self-studying can be challenging if you need to maintain the same level of discipline, and our weekly structured learning schedule can provide you with the motivation to achieve your career goal.
- **Weekly live sessions with instructors**: Our instructors will conduct weekly live sessions with students to review their progress, answer questions, and provide feedback on student projects. This will be held over web conferencing tools such as Zoom or Google Meet.
- **Peer discussion and learning**: We strongly believe that peer learning and peer discussions is the key to helping everyone advance and grow faster. You will be part of a cohort of students who are also highly motivated to complete the entire course. Discussions may happen over platforms such as Matrix, Discord, or forums.
- **Assignment feedback**: You will receive personalized feedback from the instructors for each of your assignment and areas to improve, if any.

## Tuition Fees

- Total cost of USD 499 / SGD 680 for 2 months
- Split payment: USD 250 + 249 / SGD 340 + 340 per month

We hope to offer financial flexibility to those who need them: you have the
option to split the payment into 2 monthly payments, or the entire tuition fee
via a one-time payment.

At the moment, we support payment by Debit / Credit Cards, and bank transfers.
Additional local payment options may be available for students in Singapore.

Our refund policy is designed to be simple: check out our [FAQ](/docs/faq) for
more information.

**Financial Sponsorship: Pay-with-time**

While we strive to keep the tuition fees for open camp low and affordable, we
understand that it might still be out of reach for some prospective students. We
do have an alternative payment option available for these students: no tuition
fees but you will have to contribute your time after completion
to support future cohorts.

This is similar to the pay-it-forward idea where you help to guide students in
future cohorts. We will work with you to determine what’s the right amount of time
and how you can best contribute back to the school.

Regretfully, there is a limit on the number of students whom we can offer
pay-it-forward sponsorship. Please let us know in the application email if you
wish to apply for this.
